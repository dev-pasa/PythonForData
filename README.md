1. This repo contains Jupyter notebook for exercise and projects from this Udemy course.
2. This course offers fundamentals of Data Science and Machine Learning using python. This is my learning process to understand Python and hopefully move towards PySpark and SparkR, along side Apache Airflow and Apache Kafka.
